LayerCalendar by Ian Li
=======================

This is a calendar/date picker that allows separate selection of year, month, and date.

Most calendar pickers support selection of month and year together (_e.g._, "April 2011"). This means that if "April 2011" is currently selected and the user wants "December 2011", the user has to click 8 times. With LayerCalendar, the user only has to click twice: (1) select the month and (2) select the year. In cases where the current selection differs from the desired selection by either the month or the year, the user only has to click once.
